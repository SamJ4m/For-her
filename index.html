      <p>
       Hi, babyyy. I miss you so much. I wish I could hug you right now. I want to bite 
you so bad. Girl, When I'm coming over, I'm definitely giving you a hickey because 
I'm done practicing on myself. I want your hand, so please don't say no to me, 
alright? Anyway, you know ChatGPT helped a lot with this website because I only 
had a little knowledge about HTML and CSS. ChatGPT created the structure, and I 
created all the elements. It was a fun project, and the final product turned out 
better than I thought. I still have to work on this a lot and make it look even 
better, but I'll do it slowly, one thing at a time. Enough with the yapping; let's
go to the main portion of this, alright? So as I'm writing this letter in the 
middle of June, there are people who are advising me to move on. In a way I understand
where they're coming from because if I were them, perhaps I would say the same thing,
but am I going to listen to them? Hell nahhh. They only know what they saw; they don't
know what we had. Only we know that, what we had was honest. Yeah, there were times
where I didn't communicated well, but except for that, there was nothing unwell. Anyway,
I still love you as a lover; that part of me is still alive even though I never show it
because I want to respect your decision. It's the least thing I can do for you,
my love. Girlfriend or not, you will always have me by your side in whatever way you want. 
Also, I want you to know how special you are to me, so special that my heart flutters every time I look at you, 
but I can't make eye contact because your gaze makes me falter so fucking bad. You 
know, last night I was thinking that, damn, it was so worth it to wait for you all 
these years. I'm glad it's you and no one else. I'm happy it was you who left her 
mark on me, and remember, no matter what I or others say, I am NOT moving on from you. 
I fell in love with you slowly, so it's not happening in this lifetime.
